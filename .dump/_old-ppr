## Abstract.
Blockchain and associated technologies like Cryptocurrencies, NFTs & Smart Contracts have enjoyed the limelight for the better half of the past decade and have grown into a multi-billion dollar industry [1][2]. Recently, with the bankruptcy of FTX [3] (one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world), the implications of its fallout and the questionable decisions made by those in power that lead to its bankruptcy; we are, once again, forced to critically assess the blockchain ecosystem and its underlying technology. Blockchain technology is no longer in its infancy and the unreasonable amount of money being poured into this industry that never seems to deliver on any of its promises is concerning. This technology that once promised a decentralised eutopia is now the cause of billions of dollars lost in scams [4]. This paper aims to list concerns regarding blockchain technology and its inherent limitations.
