      +---> how does it tackle bloat and resulting centralisation and added cost to operate full nodes?
      |
      +---> if consensus is dependent on the scarcity of a certain resource, how does it stop centralisation around ppl who can afford said resource and/or pooling of resources?
      |
      +---> is it a fat protocol?

// our argument: decentralisation is not sustainably achivable in public permissionless blockchains in which case, any centralised alternative is orders of magnitude more efficient and can be tweaked to provide the same guarentees of transparency and tamper evidence

// other issues
- performance
- scaling

- 51% attack
- Double-spend
- Sybil attack
- Selfish-mining
- Roguze miner
- Eclipse attack
- Replay attack
- Denial-of-service (DoS)
- Smart contract attack
- network split

- no good consensus mechanism for bft
- cryptocurrencies are fundamentally broken
- only good use case is crime
